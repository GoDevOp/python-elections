The Associated Press client
===========================

Retrieving data
===============

The AP client is public class you can use to connect to the AP's data feed.

.. function:: client.get_state(state_postal_code)

   Takes a single state postal code, returns that state's results. ::

        >>> from elections import AP
        >>> client = AP(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
        >>> client.get_state('IA')
        <State: IA>

.. function:: client.get_states(*state_postal_codes)

   Takes one to many state postal codes as arguments, returns a list of results for the requested states. ::

        >>> from elections import AP
        >>> client = AP(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
        >>> client.get_states('IA', 'NH')
        [<State: IA>, <State: NH>]

.. function:: client.get_topofticket(election_date)

   Top of the ticket is an AP data service that provides limited results on the top races for all 50 states (i.e. President, Governor, US Senate, and US House). It requires a date in any common format, YYYY-MM-DD is preferred, and returns all results for that date. ::

   If you do not provide a date, it defaults to the next major election. Today that is the Nov. 6, 2012 general election.

        >>> from elections import AP
        >>> client = AP(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
        >>> client.get_topofticket('2012-02-07')
        <TopOfTicket: 20120207>

..   function:: client.get_presidential_summary(districts=False)

    Returns a summary of presidential election results at three levels: nationwide popular vote and electoral vote; state-level popular vote and electoral vote; county-level popular vote.

    If `districts` is provided and set to True the results will include Congressional district-level results in the two states that break out their presidential electors: Maine and Nebraska. This feature only works if the AP has given your account access to the ME and NE data folders. By default, `districts` is set to False.

        >>> from elections import AP
        >>> client = AP(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
        >>> client.get_presidential_summary()
        <PresidentialSummary: None>

.. function:: client.get_delegate_summary()

   Return a nationwide summary and state-level totals contain delegate counts for all the candidates in the presidential nomination contest held by the two major parties.

   **Warning:** This method does not currently work because the 2012 primaries are over and the AP has removed the folders it depends on.

        >>> from elections import AP
        >>> client = AP(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
        >>> client.documents.get_delegate_summary()
        [<Nomination: Dem>, <Nomination: GOP>]

Election Result Collections
===========================
