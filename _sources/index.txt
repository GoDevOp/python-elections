Requirements
============

In order to use this library, you must pay AP for access to the data. More information can be found on `the AP’s web site <http://www.apdigitalnews.com/ap_elections.html>`_ or by contacting Anthony Marquez at `amarquez@ap.org <mailto:amarquez@ap.org>`_.

Getting Started
===============

Provided that you have `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ installed, you can install the library like so.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install python-elections

If you'd rather work on the source code, you can clone it from GitHub using the usual methods.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/datadesk/python-elections.git

Creating a client
-----------------

Before you can interact with AP's data, you first must import the library and initialize a client to talk with the FTP on your behalf. ::

    >>> from elections import AP
    >>> client = AP(USERNAME, PASSWORD)

.. raw:: html

   <hr>

Some basics
-----------

Request all the data available for a particular state by providing its postal code. This will return a state object.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> iowa = client.get_state('IA')
    >>> iowa
    <State: IA>

Among other things, the state has a list of races.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> iowa.races
    [<Race: GOP Caucus - President>]

The race contains a list of candidates.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> iowa.races[0].candidates
    [<Candidate: Other>, <Candidate: Jon Huntsman>, <Candidate: Newt Gingrich>, <Candidate: Herman Cain>, <Candidate: Rick Santorum> ... 

You can find results for the whole state.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> iowa.races[0].state.results
    [<Result: Newt Gingrich, Iowa (state), 896249>, <Result: Michele Bachmann, Iowa (state), 879444>, <Result: Rick Perry, Iowa (state), 65426>, ...

You can get all counties in the state.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> iowa.races[0].counties
    [<ReportingUnit: Adair>, <ReportingUnit: Adams>, <ReportingUnit: Allamakee>, <ReportingUnit: Appanoose>, <ReportingUnit: Audubon>, ...

And, of course, the results in each county.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> iowa.races[0].counties[0].results
    [<Result: Michele Bachmann, Adair, 2496>, <Result: Newt Gingrich, Adair, 2219>, <Result: Rick Santorum, Adair, 191>, ...

A working example
-----------------

Let’s say the GOP is hold­ing its caucuses in Iowa, and your news or­gan­iz­a­tion bought ac­cess to the AP’s FTP ser­vice. Your boss wants you to write a simple wid­get that will sit on the homepage and out­put live res­ults. All you need are the can­did­ate names, their vote totals and per­cent­ages, the num­ber of pre­cincts re­port­ing, the num­ber of del­eg­ates won and wheth­er the AP has called a win­ner yet. How do you feed it? Here's how.

.. code-block:: python

    from elections import AP
    try:
        import json
    except ImportError:
        import simplejson as json

    client = AP(uname, pwd)
    iowa = client.get_state('IA') 
    # Now the iowa variable holds all of the AP result data
    caucus = iowa.filter_races(office_name='President', party='GOP')[0] 
    # caucus is a Race object containing the results of the GOP caucuses

    # Set up the main data dict and set the percent of precincts reporting
    data = {
        'precincts_reporting_percent': caucus.state.precincts_reporting_percent,
        'candidates': []
    }

    # Loop through the statewide candidate results, and append them
    # in a format we like into the data dict's candidate list.
    for result in caucus.state.results:
        data['candidates'].append({
            'name': result.candidate.last_name,
            'vote_total': result.vote_total,
            'vote_percent': result.vote_total_percent,
            'delegate_total': result.candidate.delegates,
            'is_winner': result.candidate.is_winner,
        })

    # Then dump the data dict out as JSON
    print json.dumps(data, indent=4)

There you have it: a simple JSON dump in about 20 lines of code. From here, you can set this script to up­load the JSON file every few minutes to Amazon S3 or a sim­il­ar file-serving ser­vice. Then point your front-end wid­get to pull from there.

The AP Client
=============

The AP client is public class you can use to connect to the AP's data feed.

.. function:: client.get_state(state_postal_code)

   Takes a single state postal code, returns that state's results. ::

        >>> from elections import AP
        >>> client = AP(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
        >>> client.documents.get_state('IA')
        <State: IA>

.. function:: client.get_states(*state_postal_codes)

   Takes one to many state postal codes as arguments, returns a list of results for the requested states. ::

        >>> from elections import AP
        >>> client = AP(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
        >>> client.documents.get_states('IA', 'NH')
        [<State: IA>, <State: NH>]

.. function:: client.get_topofticket(election_date)

   Takes a date in any common format (YYYY-MM-DD is preferred) and returns all results for that date. May be required if you havn't purchased the detailed state level result files harvested by the methods above. ::

        >>> from elections import AP
        >>> client = AP(USERNAME, PASSWORD)
        >>> feb7 = client.documents.get_topofticket('2012-02-07')
        <TopOfTicket: 20120207>

Result Collections
==================

Depending on which client method you use to harvest data, results may be returned as `State` or `TopOfTicket` objects. Don't worry about the distinction, because they act pretty much the same. They share the following attributes for you to use.

.. attribute:: obj.counties

    Returns a list of all the counties from the pool of reporting units.

        >>> obj = client.get_state('IA')
        >>> obj.counties
        [<ReportingUnit: Guthrie>, <ReportingUnit: Union>, <ReportingUnit: Crawford>, <ReportingUnit: Wright>, <ReportingUnit: Tama>, <ReportingUnit: Hamilton>, <ReportingUnit: Worth>, <ReportingUnit: Hancock>, <ReportingUnit: Cherokee>, <ReportingUnit: Carroll>, <ReportingUnit: Webster>, <ReportingUnit: Clarke>, ...]

.. function:: obj.filter_races(**kwargs)

   Takes a series of keyword arguments and returns any races that match.
        
        >>> obj = client.get_state('IA')
        >>> obj.filter_races(office_name='President', party='GOP')
        [<Race: GOP Caucus - President>]

.. attribute:: obj.races

    Returns a list of all the races reporting results.

        >>> obj = client.get_state('IA')
        >>> obj.races
        [<Race: GOP Caucus - President>]

.. attribute:: obj.reporting_units

    Returns a list of all reporting units in the result collection.

        >>> obj = client.get_state("IA")
        >>> obj.reporting_units
        [<ReportingUnit: Guthrie>, <ReportingUnit: Union>, <ReportingUnit: Crawford>, <ReportingUnit: Wright>, <ReportingUnit: Tama>, <ReportingUnit: Hamilton>, <ReportingUnit: Worth>, <ReportingUnit: Hancock>, <ReportingUnit: Cherokee>, <ReportingUnit: Carroll>, <ReportingUnit: Webster>, <ReportingUnit: Clarke>, ...]

.. attribute:: obj.states

      Returns a list of all the states from the pool of reporting units. Only available on `TopOfTicket` result collections.

        >>> obj = client.get_topofticket('2012-02-07')
        >>> obj.states
        [<ReportingUnit: Missouri (state)>, <ReportingUnit: Minnesota (state)>, <ReportingUnit: Colorado (state)>]
